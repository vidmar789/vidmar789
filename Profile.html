    <h2>My Profile</h2>
<p>
    Here's a little more about my background and achievements.
    I completed my Senior High School at Asian Learning Center INC., Danao Campus, where I took the GAS (General Academic Strand), which helped me build a well-rounded academic foundation and strengthen my critical thinking and communication skills.
    Currently, I am studying at CITE (Center for Industrial Technology and Enterprise) Technical Institute, Inc., pursuing a diploma in Computer Engineering Technology.
    Through this program, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in computer systems, programming, electronics, and networking.
    I enjoy working on technical projects, learning new technologies, and continuously improving my skills to prepare for a future career in the tech industry.
